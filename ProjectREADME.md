  ## Description

  This project generates a professional README based on user inputs. The goal is to simplify the creation of README files and ensure consistency. The project uses the command terminal to prompt user input. In this project I learned about node packages, writing files, and different variable declarations among other skills.

  ## Installation

    First, copy the code onto your personal computer as found in the Github Repo. Next, install node.js. Additionally, after node.js has been installed, you will need to install the Inquirer.js package. Finaly, after installing node.js and inquirer, open an integrated terminal from the project code.  Run the command <mark>npm i inquirer@8.2.4</mark> to install the package. 

  ## Usage

   In the same integrated terminal run the command <mark>node index.js</mark> A series of questions will appear in the terminal. You will be prompted for the following sections of your README: Title, License, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. Enter as much detail as needed for each respective section. For best results do not attempt to format lists or breaks through the command terminal. After the README has generated, you will be able to make any slight edits needed.
